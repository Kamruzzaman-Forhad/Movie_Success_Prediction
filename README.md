# Movie_Success_Prediction

The number of movies created around the world is increasing at an
exponential pace, and the success rate of each film is critical since billions of dollars
are invested in its production. Prior knowledge of a movie's success or failure, as
well as the factors that influence its performance, will assist production companies
in this situation, since these predictions will give them a good notion of how to
approach advertising and campaigning, which is an expensive endeavor in and of
itself. As a result, predicting a film's success is critical to the film business. We
provide our detailed analysis of the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and forecast
the IMDb score in this proposed study. This database includes both category and
numerical data, such as IMDb score, director, gross, budget, and so forth. In the
proposed study, we employed a feature selection approach and a variety of
algorithms to analyze the data, but Random Forest provided the greatest prediction
accuracy, which is better than earlier studies. The number of voted users, number of
critics for reviews, number of Facebook likes, duration of the movie, and gross
collection of the movie all have a significant impact on the IMDb score, according
to the exploratory investigation. In terms of genres, drama and biopic films are the
greatest.
